# SimpleWidgetLibraryForTesting

A throwaway test project answering one question: **can an Android home-screen App Widget live inside a library module** (`appwidgetlibrary`) rather than in the app itself, and still work when the app depends on it?

Not meant as a reusable library — it's the experiment, kept for reference.

## What's in here

| Module | What it is |
|---|---|
| `appwidgetlibrary/` | A library module containing an `AppWidgetProvider` (`MyAppWidget1`) and a small `WebActivity` |
| `app/` | A demo app that depends on the module and hosts the widget |

## The point

`appwidgetlibrary/src/main/java/.../WidgetRelated/MyAppWidget1.java` is the home-screen widget, declared in the **library's** manifest. The app module just pulls the library in — proving a widget provider and its manifest entry survive being packaged in an Android library.

## Build and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p32929/SimpleWidgetLibraryForTesting.git
```

Open it in Android Studio, run the `app` module on a device/emulator, then add the widget from your launcher's widget picker.
